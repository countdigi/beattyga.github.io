# Minecraft for "Dummies"

When I started playing minecraft I had no idea how to play so here are some webpages that will help:
- [fandom](https://www.fandom.com/topics/games)
- [minecrafts website](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us)

If you want to know more about Minecraft and how to play then go onto Youtube and see if you can find a good video about how to play. If you still need help, I would be happy to help.

When you open Minecraft you should see a screen that looks like this:

What you want to do is click on the top button this will open the create a world menu. After that you'll need to click on the button that says survival and keep doing that until it says creative. Then click create new world and wait to load in. On entry you'll have to move and clicking `W` will let you move forward. If you hold `W` you'll move more smoothly. If you move your mouse left and right you can look left and right. Next press the button `E` to open up your inventory here you can get blocks and put them in your hot bar. If you press `E` again you can exit your inventory. Now use the scroll wheel on your mouse to change the slot you are on in your hot bar. Then once your on the block you got, press the right button on your mouse to place the block in your hand. To break the block press the left button on the mouse. Now comes the most important part: goof off! I know it sounds random but it really helps just to do anything that's creative. I mean after all, it's called Creative mode.
